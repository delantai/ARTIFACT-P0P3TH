# ARTIFACT P0P3TH

A recent deep dive into the metaverse has produced a new artifact (SN: P0P3TH). Help us discover how it works:

https://artifact-p0p3th.vercel.app/

(test address: `0xB35eC98Ba0A1Cf6b5C1d836A818D041A7CD9AA19`)

Currently awaiting approval from OpenSea, so for now only Rinkeby API Testnets addresses work.

This project presented me the opportunity to explore something I've been curious about for a while: building an interactive 3D asset within a simple web app. I was impressed with the [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) library, and ended up learning about some of the capabilities of WebGL + ThreeJS + Fiber through this experiment. Hope you enjoy!
